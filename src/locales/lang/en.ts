            For every $SOS token staked, you will receive $veSOS in return. $veSOS comes with full voting rights within the OpenDAO and can be used as the governance token in other
            protocols and projects in addition to becoming eligible for potential airdrops too.
            <br />
            <br />
            $veSOS is automatically compounded for your benefit. Upon unstaking, you will receive your original $SOS plus any additional $SOS from the official staking pool or other
            revenue sources.
